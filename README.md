I’m a Senior GCP Engineer with experience in cloud platforms, data engineering, and modern application development. I enjoy building scalable solutions, solving complex problems, and continuously learning new technologies.  
Recently, I’ve been exploring Generative AI, LLMs, and how they can be integrated into real-world applications using tools like APIs, FastAPI, and modern cloud services.  
Outside of work, I’m passionate about fitness, running, yoga, and mindfulness — disciplines that help me stay focused, disciplined, and resilient both personally and professionally.  
Always open to learning, collaboration, and meaningful conversations around technology and growth.
